Code associated with Wood et al. 2022. "The weaker sex: Male lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) with blue color polymorphism are more burdened by parasites than are other sex–color combinations." PLoS One.

This code refers to two datasets: one on the abundance of parasites within the 89 lingcod hosts that were subjected to parasitological dissection (lingcod_psite_data.csv), and one on the sex, color, and body condition of all 2,091 lingcod collected across the study area (lingcod_population.csv).

Data are available in this repository, and are also permanently archived in Dryad:
